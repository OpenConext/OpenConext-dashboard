### [About OpenConext](#about_openConext)

The OpenConext dashboard is the module that can be used by people managing an Identity Provider (IdP) connected to the (OpenConext) identity hub/proxy. It offers an option for an IdP to check out what SPs (Service Provider) are connected to the proxy, request connection to an SP, look up information about SPs connected to the hub etc. This (IdP) dashboard offers the IdPs a high level of 'DIY', offloading work from the federation operator (less error prone emails to deal with concerning connecting/disconnecting an IdP to an SP, thereby offering scalability (SURF runs SURFconext with hundreds of IdPs)
