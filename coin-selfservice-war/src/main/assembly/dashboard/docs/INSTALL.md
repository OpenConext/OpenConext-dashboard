## 1. UNPACK TARBALL

Unpack the provided tarball on the server that you want to deploy
the application on. e.g. extract the tarball in /tmp


## 2. PREPARE TOMCAT

This installation document only provides documentation for the Tomcat application server.

If you already have deployed a previous version of the dashboard application
you must follow step 2.2a to undeploy the previous version.

If you have not deployed a previous version yet, follow 2.2b instead.

### 2.1 Stop Tomcat

Stop the tomcat application server

### 2.2a Undeploy a previous version (optional)
Navigate to the `<<CATALINA_HOME>>/wars/`
(e.g. /opt/tomcat/wars/)
delete the `dashboard-war-<<VERION>>.war` file.
(e.g. dashboard-war-2.6.0-SNAPSHOT.war)

Navigate to `<<CATALINA_HOME>>/work/dashboard.{dev,test,acc}.surfconext.nl/`
Delete the entire selfservice directory listed there.

### 2.2b Prepare Tomcat for first time deployment
Create a webapps holder directory:
`<<CATALINA_HOME>>/webapps/dashboard.{dev,test,acc}.surfconext.nl/`
and give ownership to tomcat:
`chown tomcat:tomcat <<CATALINA_HOME>>/webapps/dashboard.{dev,test,acc}.surfconext.nl/`


### 2.3 Copy / edit property files

Out-of-the-box the tarball comes with a number of different property files.
A number of property files are delivered:

- dashboard.properties.<<ENV>>
- selfservice-ehcache.xml.<<ENV>>


For different environments different property files are delivered. Pick the
appropriate property file for your environment from the following directory:
`<<EXTRACTED_TAR_BALL_PATH>>/tomcat/conf/classpath_properties`

Copy the chosen property files to:
`<<CATALINA_HOME>>/conf/classpath_properties/dashboard.properties`
`<<CATALINA_HOME>>/conf/classpath_properties/selfservice-ehcache.xml`
`<<CATALINA_HOME>>/conf/classpath_properties/dashboard-logback.xml`

Edit the values of the property files according to your environment.


## 3. DEPLOY WAR FILE

Copy the provided context descriptor from
`<<EXTRACTED_TAR_BALL_PATH>>/tomcat/conf/context`
to
`<<CATALINA_HOME>>/conf/Catalina/<<SELFSERVICE-VIRTUAL-HOST-DIRECTORY>>`
(e.g. /opt/tomcat/conf/Catalina/dashboard.dev.surfconext.nl)

Now, copy the coin-portal war located at
`<<EXTRACTED_TAR_BALL_PATH>>/tomcat/webapps`
to
`<<CATALINA_HOME>>/wars/`
(e.g. /opt/tomcat/wars/


## 4. START TOMCAT

Start tomcat again.
